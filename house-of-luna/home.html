The House of Luna is an interactive doll house, for you to explore! The house has 3 rooms, each with their own special features: The living room, kitchen, and bedroom. Feel free to roam the rooms, by clicking on the door to the left, which will slide out to reveal the navigation.
<br /><br />Living Room<br /><br />
This is where you can entertain yourself by listening to the radio, or watching different shows on the television. You can click on the radio to bring you closer to it. Then click on any of the square buttons to select a song. Press the dark square to turn off the music. Click on the TV to have a closer look. Then click on either of the 3 knobs to start a video! You can click on either the radio or the TV again to return to the living room.
<br /><br />Kitchen<br /><br />
This is where you can draw anything you like, as if drawing something to stick up on your fridge. Just select a colour from the drop down menu, and click and drag inside the white canvas to make a mark. You can also erase by selecting the white colour option!
<br /><br />Bedroom<br /><br />
This is where you can meet the doll of the house. By clicking on the closet, you will be able to dress her up with different outfits. She has different dresses, shoes, and faces. Just click, drag and drop the clothes and accessories you like over the doll!
